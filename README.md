Title: 
Internet Banking Console Application

Introduction:
NWBA (National Wealth Bank of Australasia) has hired you to design their Internet Banking system. It is a simulated banking application. When complete, the system will be able to:
• Check balances & transaction history
• Simulate transactions such as deposits and withdrawals
• Transfer money between accounts

The system pre-loads customer, account and login information from provided webservices. A REST call to these services is required to download JSON data which is then loaded into the backend database.

Technologies:
•.NET Core 3.0, 
•C# using Visual Studio 2019
•Cloud Microsoft SQL Server backend
•ADO.NET

Launch:
To launch this Program, just run the program by clicking build and debug or directly play via play button.

Scope:
The aim of this assignment is to develop a menu-based console application for Internet Banking with .NET Core 3.0 written in C# using Visual Studio 2019 with a Cloud Microsoft SQL Server backend. 
Database access is to be implemented with ADO.NET and SQL using the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package as the provider. Use of ORM is not allowed at this stage, you must only use SQL for database related operations.

Project Status:
Will further extend its functionality to:
• Schedule payments
• Modify a personal profile
• Apply for loans
• Perform some administrative tasks
